# Bamazon

# Node.js & MySQL

## Overview

In this app, I create an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skillst. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

The app includes three js files : bamazonCustomer, bamazonManager, and  bamazonSupervisor


 # Customer View:


1. create a Table inside of the database (which I called it bamazon) called `products`.

2. The products table ave each of the following columns:

   * item_id (unique id for each product)

   * product_name (Name of product)

   * department_name

   * price (cost to customer)

   * stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)

3. Populate this database with around 10 different products.
4. Then create a Node application called `bamazonCustomer.js`. Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.

5. The app then prompt users with two messages.

   * The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
   * The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

6. Once the customer has placed the order, the application  check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

   * If not, the app should log a phrase like `Insufficient quantity!`, and then prevent the order from going through.

7. However, if the store _does_ have enough of the product, the app fulfill the customer's order.
   * This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.
   * Once the update goes through, it shows the customer the total cost of their purchase.

 # Manager View :

* Create a new Node application called `bamazonManager.js`. Running this application will:

  * List a set of menu options:

    * View Products for Sale
    
    * View Low Inventory
    
    * Add to Inventory
    
    * Add New Product

  * If a manager selects `View Products for Sale`, the app should list every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.

  * If a manager selects `View Low Inventory`, then it should list all items with an inventory count lower than five.

  * If a manager selects `Add to Inventory`, your app should display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.

  * If a manager selects `Add New Product`, it should allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.

# Supervisor View :

1. Create a new MySQL table called `departments`. It includes the following columns:

   * department_id

   * department_name

   * over_head_costs (A dummy number you set for each department)

2. Modify the products table so that there's a product_sales column, and modify  `bamazonCustomer.js` app so that when a customer purchases anything from the store, the price of the product multiplied by the quantity purchased is added to the product's product_sales column.


3. Create another Node app called `bamazonSupervisor.js`. Running this application will list a set of menu options:

   * View Product Sales by Department
   
   * Create New Department

4. When a supervisor selects `View Product Sales by Department`, the app  display a summarized table in their terminal/bash window. 
Use the table below as a guide.

| department_id | department_name | over_head_costs | product_sales | total_profit |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 01            | Electronics     | 10000           | 20000         | 10000        |
| 02            | Clothing        | 60000           | 100000        | 40000        |

5. The `total_profit` column is calculated on the fly using the difference between `over_head_costs` and `product_sales`. 
`total_profit` should not be stored in any database.
